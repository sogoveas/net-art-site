          the behavior of ‘synthia,’ the subject of the sculpture is determined by real-time stock market fluctuations. suynthia has sixteen predetermined actions based upon two percent changes in accumulated stock data (based on Dow Jones Industrial average, NASDAQ, S&P500 and the Russell Cap Indexes). when the market has an upward trend, synthia dances and shops at

          a feminist response to the rise of the internet and virtual identity. she is part of leeson's expansion of her exploration of artifical identity, surveillance, and female authonomy. this sculpture is tied to data and how it relates to the value of women in society. the women is commodified, the value of women in society is depicted wherein the value of women is tied to stock prices. women's bodies, labor, and roles are confined to economic assets. the sole identity of women in this sculpture is manipulated, tracked, and measured by a system out of their control. this piece is a part of leeson's larger work focused on cyberfeminism - using technology to challenge gender norms in the digital space. once more, the viewer is the voyeur. how does media percieve an emotional life.
