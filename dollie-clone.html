    <h3> CYBEROBERTA</h3>
    <h5> LYNN HERSHMAN LEESON</h5>
    <h5> ”when the dollie clones were born, I thought to convert Roberta, who had been exorcised about five years earlier, and have her re-emerge as this kind of evil twin that would steal information from Tillie when they were in some proximity.”

    Leeson adopted many personalities, notably Roberta Breitmore, who she felt the need to exorcise in 1978. She has lived as Roberta betwenn 1973 and 1978, even creating a ID, having therapist appointments, and public interactions.  </h5>
